# Automated Treasury

Buck protocol can handle excess and deficit of DAI collateral automatically, without users intervention.&#x20;

When the Effective Collateral Ratio (ECR) is <mark style="color:purple;">**above**</mark> the Target Collateral Ratio (TCR), the excess DAI will be transferred from collateral pool to another smartcontract as treasury.&#x20;

When the ECR is <mark style="color:purple;">**below**</mark> the TCR, DAI from treasury will be added automatically to collateral pool, without user intervention.
