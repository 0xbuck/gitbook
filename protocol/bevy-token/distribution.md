# Distribution

The total planned emission of BEVY token is 100 million.

## <mark style="color:purple;">Community (75% of BEVY)</mark>

DeFi Protocols have made use of liquidity programs to jumpstart growth and distribute protocol tokens to community members. To that end, 75% of all BEVY tokens are to be distributed through BEVY minting, various yield farming, liquidity incentives, and exclusive governance proposals across a number of years.&#x20;

Community governance can decide which pools, programs, and initiatives to support with the emission schedule, but it cannot be increased past the 100,000,000 BEVY supply max. Thus, a maximum of 74,995,000 BEVY will be distributed to the community for liquidity programs and other DeFi initiatives as they appear in the space as voted by governance. New programs can be added by governance to the remaining allocation, but no more than 74,995,000 BEVY can be allocated due to the hard cap of 100,000,000 BEVY distributed. This is to put a hard cap on the amount of BEVY as well as to put a hard duration on the number of years required to distribute the BEVY.

The daily emission of BEVY is subject to change, as the team creates new pools, deactivates pools, changes the rate of rewards for some pools or allocates some BEVY rewards as boosted rewards to incentivize a pool with partner(s) of BUCK Stablecoin.

## <mark style="color:purple;">IDO Launchpad (2% of BEVY)</mark>

On the first year, we decided to join several IDO on Launchpad Projects in various protocol mainly on Arbitrum and Polygon Network, with allocation of 2% BEVY (2,000,0000 BEVY).

## <mark style="color:purple;">Airdrop (0,00005% of BEVY)</mark>

We have successfully distribute the first round of BEVY Airdrop worth US$ 10,000 (2,858 BEVY).&#x20;

For the upcoming second **** round of $BEVY Airdrop we will allocate US$ 7,500 worth of BEVY (2,142 BEVY).&#x20;

## <mark style="color:purple;">Team and Investors (23% of BEVY)</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**7.5% – Team  – 12 months vesting, 6 month cliff**</mark>\
****Buck Stabelcoin Protocol was conceived in late 2021 and target launch in early 2022. Although, the beta mainnet is just now being launched, the contributions of founders and early members that have been working on BUCK Stablecoin was crucial to releasing the protocol. The team will continue to work on BUCK Stablecoin for its lifetime along with the greater community.&#x20;

This percentage (7,499,500 BEVY) will come from the 10% of BEVY minting bonus and BEVY farming bonus that will be received by minters (a.k.a recollateralizer) / yield farmers.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**5.5% – Founder  – 12 months vesting, 6 month cliff**</mark>\
****5,500,500 BEVY Tokens are retained for founders as original early contributors to BUCK Stablecoin. &#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**10% – Private Investors – 5% vested over the first 6 months, 5% vested over 1 year with a 6 month cliff**</mark>&#x20;

The remainder of the round will be done individually through private placements. The remaining 10% is vested evenly over 1 year, half of which has a 6 month cliff.&#x20;
