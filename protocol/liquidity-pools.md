# Liquidity Pools

At the beginning, the liquidity of BEVY might affect the stability of our entire system. So, weâ€™ll use only one pool for each pair to ensure high liquidity.

After IDO, we will provide liquidity for BEVY/ETH and BUCK/ETH pairs on <mark style="color:purple;">**Sushiswap Arbitrum.**</mark>

We will also provide liquidity for BEVY/MATIC and BUCK/MATIC pairs on <mark style="color:purple;">**QuickSwap (Polygon).**</mark>
